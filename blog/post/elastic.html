    <h1>Featured at Elastic.co</h1>
    <p>The <a href="https://br.biodiversity.cloud">Rapid Automated Risk Assessment</a> tool was shortlisted for this yearâ€™s inaugural <a href="https://www.elastic.co/causeawards">Elastic Cause Awards</a>, which recognizes organizations using the Elastic Stack to do great good in the world.</p>

<p>Our recommendation was a great surprise, specially since we were selected without prior submission. Even if we were not selected for the final award, it was still a nice recognition.</p>

<p>All given they invited us to share our story on <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/providing-extinction-risk-assessments-for-biodiversity-with-elasticsearch">Providing extinction risk assessments for biodiversity with Elasticsearch</a> on their featured blog.</p>
