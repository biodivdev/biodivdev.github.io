The [Rapid Automated Risk Assessment](https://br.biodiversity.cloud) tool was shortlisted for this yearâ€™s inaugural [Elastic Cause Awards](https://www.elastic.co/causeawards), which recognizes organizations using the Elastic Stack to do great good in the world.

Our recommendation was a great surprise, specially since we were selected without prior submission. Even if we were not selected for the final award, it was still a nice recognition.

All given they invited us to share our story on [Providing extinction risk assessments for biodiversity with Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/blog/providing-extinction-risk-assessments-for-biodiversity-with-elasticsearch) on their featured blog.
