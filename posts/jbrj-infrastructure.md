Even if [RRAPP](https://br.biodiversity.cloud) was initially developed inside Brazil's [National Centre for Flora Conservation](http://cncflora.jbrj.gov.br), of [Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden](http://jbrj.gov.br), it was runing at my personal (Diogo) servers at [Scaleway](https://scaleway.com).

Now with the research institute being able to provide new server the project will be able to grow in data size,  that was already limited on a single server.
